# hotrace
## Subject
You need to create a search engine, that will work using a 2 steps process:
* Step 1: It will read on the stdin, and store for every keyword, his value in the memory.  
* Step 2: When it finds a '\n', the algorithm need to proceed the phase 2, meaning that from now your algorithm is gonna look for the word  
in the memory, and return you the value that was attached to.
These instructions will follow this format:  
```
key-word-1
value-1
key-word-2
value-2
[...]

key-word-2
value-2
key-word-invalid
Not found.
```
