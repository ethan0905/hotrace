Coding a search engine is not that hard, but coding an efficent one, is a far more complicated task. It has been years that Google, Yahoo, Bing and more are engaging themselves in a battle of efficiency. A battle where everyone is in a mad rush : the HotRace.

You need to create a search engine, that will work using a 2 steps process:
* Step 1: It will read on the stdin, and store for every keyword, his value in the memory.  
* Step 2: When it finds a '\n', the algorithm need to proceed the phase 2, meaning that from now your algorithm is gonna look for the word in the memory, and return you the value that was attached to.
These instructions will follow this format:  
```
key-word-1
value-1
key-word-2
value-2
[...]
key-word-x
value-x

key-word-2
value-2
key-word-invalid
Not found.
```
